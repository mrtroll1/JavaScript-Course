/* 
I leave this to myself as a backend exercise.

The goal would be to create the data for the 
packages array remotely and send requests 
to the server.

This data should at the end of the day be
an array of objects {
    orderId:
    productId:
    quantity: 
    deliveryDate:
}

It will be used to properly render the arival
dates on the orders and tracking pages.
